== Tracebility Matrix

> It is used to track the requirements and to check the current project requirements are met.

In software development, a traceability matrix (TM)[1]:244 is a document, usually in the form of a table, used to assist in determining the completeness of a relationship by correlating any two baselined documents using a many-to-many relationship comparison.[1]:3â€“22 It is often used with high-level requirements (these often consist of marketing requirements) and detailed requirements of the product to the matching parts of high-level design, detailed design, test plan, and test cases.

Quality is not equal to test.
Quality is achieved by putting development and testing into a blender and mixing them
until one is indistinguishable from the other.

TIP: checks when a resource was uploaded/downloaded from internet/network

Web link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies[Cookies]?::
Reliable way to store stateful information about a website on browser.

* Analyze each individual network call including {TTFB}, headers, respose, http code etc.
* How does a URL sets a cookie in browser?
* Asciidoc - to add links to in headings use `link:` macro
* To Annotate images use `Krita` and to crop/resize `ShotWell` or `gThumb`

.Difference between `XHR` and `fetch` API
. Fetch uses `Promises` avoiding callback hell.
. You can use the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache[Cache API] with the request and response objects
. You can perform no-cors requests, getting a response from a server that doesn't implement CORS. You can't access the response body directly from JavaScript, but you can use it with other APIs (e.g. the Cache API)
. Streaming responses (with XHR the entire response is *buffered in memory*, with fetch you will be able to access the low-level stream). This isn't available yet in all browsers, but will be soon.

[source,javascript]
----
let reqHeader = new Headers(); <5>
reqHeader.append('Content-Type', 'text/json');
let requestObject = {
    method: 'GET', headers: reqHeader,
};

fetch('https://api.github.com/users/avimehenwal', requestObject) <4>
.then(function (response) { <1>
    return response.json();
})
.then(function (data) { <2>
    console.log(data);
})
.catch(function (err) { <3>
    console.log("Something went wrong!", err);
});
----
<1> Resolve request promise
<2> `respose.json()` yields another promise
<3> Catch if Promise is not resolved
<4> Add request parameters to special kind of request
<5> Add request Headers

What is the difference between link:https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/1120[Amplify and Cognito]?::
Recently they've been bundling all their SDKs into Amplify to streamline the integration process.
