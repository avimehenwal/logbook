= GIT

== Software Model

* Version could be kept by having a directory of snapshots with timestamps
* Git is fancier, it uses **DAG** Directed Acyclic Graph
* Object are put into store as hashes
  * turns big chunks of bytes to fixed length strings
* Git comics
* Hosting git versions of github, interacting with `remotes` objects
