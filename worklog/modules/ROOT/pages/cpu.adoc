> The more the number of transistors, the more work can CPU do

IMPORTANT: Monitor space weather, especially solar flares. 100 years ago there was one that fried all electronics on earth

Every software/code you write for a CPU architecture is translated to its *Machine Code* aka {ISA}

General norm is, *ARM* for mobile and *X86* for computers/desktops

=== History

* Ryzen launched in 2017 with new *ZEN Microarchitecture*

> How did AMD made their new processors faster?

* Faster single core {IPC} -> better performance
* Cache Latency, Doubled L3 cache size to *32MB*
* Branch Prediction
** If branch predictior makes a mistakes, entire instruction has to be purged and it might take upto *25* cycles to get the new instruction.
** {AMD} uses Perceptron branch prediction https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1431573[Tagged geometric branch prediction]
* All remaing at *105W*

Clock speed of CPU?::
  How quickly CPU can execute its basic operations.
  Used to coordinate various parts of the various partss/modules of CPU.

NOTE: Various Pipelining operations performed by CPU at each clock cycle

.Pipeline Instructions
1. Instruction Fetch
2. Instruction Decode
3. Instruction Execute
4. Instruction Store

=== Foce, work, power

.Foce | work | power
|===
| Force | Newton | push / pull
| Work, Energy  | Joules | Apply force over a distance
| Power | Watt  | Rate at which work is done
|===

TIP: One Watt = One Joule per second
